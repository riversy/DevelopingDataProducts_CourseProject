# User Guide

The app is based on the work of **Fereshteh Karimeddini** [Word Cloud][1]. In the other hand I was inspired with book of **Matthew L. Jockers** [Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature][2] about how to use the data analysis in the literature science.

So, this app allows to make brief analysis of the three literature works.
